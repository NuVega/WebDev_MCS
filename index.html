						<p class="main-text">Waking up. Working out. Riding the bus. Music is an ever-present companion for many of us, and its impact is undeniable. 
						</p>
						<p class="main-text">You know music makes you move and triggers emotional responses, but how and why? What changes when you play music, rather than simply listen? 
						</p>
						<p class="main-text">In the latest episode of Tech Effects, we tried to find out. Our first stop was USC's Brain & Creativity Institute, where I headed into the fMRI to see how my brain responded to musical cuesâ€”and how my body did, too. (If you're someone who experiences frisson, that spine-tingling, hair-raising reaction to music, you know what I'm talking about.) We also talked to researchers who have studied how learning to play music can help kids become better problem-solvers, and to author Dan Levitin, who helped break down how the entire brain gets involved when you hear music.</p>
