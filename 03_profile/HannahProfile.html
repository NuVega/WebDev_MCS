	<p>Hannah Reid was born on 30 December 1989.<a href="#link1">[1]</a> She is the lead singer and songwriter of London Grammar. Reid grew up in Acton, and went to school in West London. She had classical vocal training. She wanted to pursue psychoanalysis as a career and worked as a hairdresser and in a bar before going to University. She was initially planning to pursue acting after earning a drama scholarship.</p>
	<p>Reid was studying Art History and English at University Nottingham when she started the band.<a href="#link2">[2]</a> Her battle with stage fright has been widely reported; in an interview she said about being on stage “(...)sometimes the nerves don’t lift at all, and I just feel horrible, and panicky throughout.” To help combat this phobia, she started practicing Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). She is gluten-intolerant, and in addition to avoiding certain foods, she also avoids drinking alcohol.<a href="#link1">[1]</a> Reid is also known for her expansive vocal range and emotive contralto voice.</p>

	<p>Hannah Reid and guitarist Dan Rothman met in the Ancaster Hall of residence at the University of Nottingham during their first year in 2009. Rothman saw that Reid and Rothman played the guitar and contacted her to see if she wanted to collaborate. They were joined by Northampton native Dominic 'Dot' Major (keyboard, djembe, drums) a year later, after he began playing music together with Rothman. They chose the name as "not only was it where we're from, but London is also so international and multicultural that it actually felt like quite a universal name in a way."<a href="#link3">[3]</a> After completing their studies in the middle of 2011, the trio moved down to London to pursue a career in music. The band began by playing low-key gigs at local bars, honing their material.<a href="#link4">[4]</a><a href="#link5">[5]</a> They soon found themselves noticed by a number of A&R people.<a href="#link6">[6]</a></p>
	<p>Their debut extended play, Metal & Dust, was released in February 2013 by Metal & Dust Recordings,<a href="#link5">[5]</a> while their debut album, If You Wait, was released in September 2013. The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The band's second studio album, Truth Is a Beautiful Thing, was released in June 2017, peaking at number one on the UK Albums Chart.</p>
